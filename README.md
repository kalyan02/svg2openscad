# svg2openscad

For most 3d printing stuff, I tend to use OpenSCAD which is an amazing parametric modeling software. But some shapes are easier to make using 2d design tools like sketch, etc. This tool was written to convert the svg deisgns into openscad module that you can directly use.

    Usage: svg2openscad.py -i input.svg -o output.openscad
